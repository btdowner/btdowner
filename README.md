# Hello! I'm Brandon üëã


I'm a dedicated Service Desk Analyst and a student of Network Engineering and Security at Western Governors University. I have always been fascinated by how networks function and how technology can bring people together. From an early age, I have had a deep interest in computers and networking, which has driven me to continuously expand my knowledge in these areas.  

This has inspired me to develop my own home lab, where I experiment and build my skills. While in its early stages, my home lab is growing. So far, I have set up a file server and a Minecraft server, which have given me hands-on experience with file sharing, drive mapping, and port forwarding. I am currently in the process of setting up a virtual Active Directory environment with multiple virtual machines, and I am working on creating a ‚Äúrouter on a stick‚Äù firewall using PFSense. These projects allow me to explore real-world networking concepts and security practices. 

In addition to my home lab, I am always working on new certifications to strengthen my foundation in IT and computer networking.
